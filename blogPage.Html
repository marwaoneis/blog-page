              "The more time we spend on social media, the less time we have for
              real-life, face-to-face interactions, which are crucial for our
              mental well-being." - Dr. Jane Smith

            While many of us enjoy staying connected on social media, excessive
            use can fuel feelings of addiction, anxiety, depression, isolation,
            and FOMO. Here’s how to modify your habits and improve your mood.

          <h2>The role social media plays in mental health</h2>
          <p>
            Human beings are social creatures. We need the companionship of
            others to thrive in life, and the strength of our connections has a
            huge impact on our mental health and happiness. Being socially
            connected to others can ease stress, anxiety, and depression, boost
            self-worth, provide comfort and joy, prevent loneliness, and even
            add years to your life. On the flip side, lacking strong social
            connections can pose a serious risk to your mental and emotional
            health.
          </p>
          <p>
            In today’s world, many of us rely on social media platforms such as
            Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube, and Instagram to find and
            connect with each other. While each has its benefits, it’s important
            to remember that social media can never be a replacement for
            real-world human connection. It requires in-person contact with
            others to trigger the hormones that alleviate stress and make you
            feel happier, healthier, and more positive. Ironically for a
            technology that’s designed to bring people closer together, spending
            too much time engaging with social media can actually make you feel
            more lonely and isolated—and exacerbate mental health problems such
            as anxiety and depression.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re spending an excessive amount of time on social media and
            feelings of sadness, dissatisfaction, frustration, or loneliness are
            impacting your life, it may be time to re-examine your online habits
            and find a healthier balance.

          <h3>The positive aspects of social media</h3>
          <p>
            While virtual interaction on social media doesn’t have the same
            psychological benefits as face-to-face contact, there are still many
            positive ways in which it can help you stay connected and support
            your wellbeing.

          <h3>The negative aspects of social media</h3>
          <p>
            Since it’s a relatively new technology, there’s little research to
            establish the long-term consequences, good or bad, of social media
            use. However, multiple studies have found a strong link between
            heavy social media and an increased risk for depression, anxiety,
            loneliness, self-harm, and even suicidal thoughts.
